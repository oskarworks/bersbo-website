# bersbo
A minimal, single-page holding site for **Bersbo Industries LLC**.

This site exists to establish:
- presence
- taste
- permanence

It is **not** a marketing site.
It contains no navigation, no explanation, and no calls to action.

The design prioritizes restraint, negative space, and typographic authority.

---

## Purpose

Bersbo Industries is a private holding company.

The website’s role is to signal quiet confidence and long-term intent.
If a visitor doesn’t immediately understand what the company does, that is intentional.

---

## Structure

- Single page
- Single view
- Desktop-first, responsive down
- No routes beyond `/`

Content is intentionally limited to:
- A hero wordmark: `BERSBO`
- A small footer with the legal entity name

Nothing else.

---

## Typography

- **Bodoni Moda** (Google Fonts)  
  Used exclusively for the hero wordmark.

- **Inter** (Google Fonts)  
  Used only for the footer text.

Typography is the primary design element.
Spacing and scale matter more than decoration.

---

## Design Principles

- Extreme restraint
- Large negative space
- Editorial, industrial tone
- No visual noise
- No decorative elements
- No trends

If something feels like it is “trying,” it should be removed.

---

## Motion

- Minimal fade-in on page load only
- No scroll effects
- No interactive animation

Motion should feel inevitable, not expressive.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a landing page
- Not a brand story
- Not SEO-driven
- Not conversion-oriented
- Not a startup site

---

## Editing Rules

Before making changes, ask:
> Does this increase confidence without explanation?

If the answer is no, don’t ship it.

This project is intentionally small.
Resist the urge to add.
